#### About myself

My experience includes the implementation of various projects, including some, related to web technologies. On different projects, I performed the functions of an analyst, developer, project manager, product owner. I like programming because it's a good practical tool to realize new ideas - from gathering information and data analysis to the automated decision making.

Now I am looking to acquire new skills in frontend development and to try myself in this area of activity.
